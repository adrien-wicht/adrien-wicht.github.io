I have joined the **University of Basel** as a Postdoctoral Researcher in International Economics. 

I completed my PhD in Economics at the European University Institute in 2024. Before starting this position, I was a visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania and worked as a research assistant at the European Stability Mechanism, the Robert Schuman Centre at the EUI, and the Swiss National Bank.

At the University of Basel, I continue to work on topics related to official lending and sovereign debt. You can find more details in the [publications](/research/) section.
