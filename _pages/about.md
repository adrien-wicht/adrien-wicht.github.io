I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in International Economics at the University of Basel. My research interests lie at the intersection of **macroeconomics**, **international economics**, **sovereign debt**, and **recursive contracts**. I completed my PhD at the European University Institute in 2024, where I was supervised by Ramon Marimon and Alexander Monge-Naranjo.

Previously, I held visiting and research positions at the University of Pennsylvania, the European Stability Mechanism, and the Swiss National Bank. My work has been published in the *Journal of International Economics* and the *Review of Economic Dynamics*, and includes ongoing projects on sovereign debt maturity, fiscal and environmental policy under limited commitment, and financial stability mechanisms.

My current teaching includes courses on **Advanced International Macroeconomics** (Fall 2024) and **International Money and Finance** (Spring 2025) at the University of Basel.
